# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

In this project, I build on top of the Bouncy Ball Demo using object-oriented class design, inheritance, canvas drawing, user interaction via event listeners, and real-time scoring of the balls for the balls that dissappear from the canvas when colliding with the evil circle.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine.

There is no need to install Node.js dependencies.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Running

To run the site using Live Preview in VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the 
Command Palette, then select `Live Preview: Start Server`. You can copy the URL 
from the VS Code Live Preview and paste it into a web browser such as Chrome to 
view the site externally.

To end Live Preview, open Command Palette and select `Live Preview: Stop Server`.

## Testing

There are no written tests for this project.
